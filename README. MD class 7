Domain Modeling

#Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

Tables should not be used for tabular data  for the reason listed below.
Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users: screen readers, used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.
Tables produce tag soup: As mentioned above, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
Tables are not automatically responsive: When you use proper layout containers (such as <header>, <section>, <article>, or <div>), their width defaults to 100% of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

A contructor is creating more than one object from a single object definition, and that's the subject of the next section. 

This refers to the curremt object the code iss being written inside 

Prototypes is property that referenes and object. Anticlimatic, right?  and inheritance
