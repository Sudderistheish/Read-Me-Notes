API Design Best Practices
1.	REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2.	REST APIs are designed around resources.
3.	An identifier of a resource is a unique URL that represents the resource. An example of a resource identifier is: https://example.com/api/users/123
4.	The most common HTTP verbs used in RESTful APIs are:
•	GET: Used to retrieve data from a resource.
•	POST: Used to create new resources or submit data to be processed.
•	PUT: Used to update existing resources with new data.
•	DELETE: Used to remove resources.
5.	URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) should be based on the concept of identifying resources, meaning they should represent the resources themselves rather than actions or operations.
6.	Example of a good URI: https://example.com/api/products/789
7.	Having a 'chatty' web API means that the API exposes many small resources that require multiple requests to retrieve all the required data. This is generally considered a bad thing because it can lead to increased network overhead and slower performance. It's more efficient to have APIs that expose larger resources that provide all the necessary data in a single request.
8.	A successful GET request returns a status code of 200 OK.
9.	An unsuccessful GET request returns a status code in the 4xx range, such as:
•	404 Not Found: When the requested resource is not found.
•	401 Unauthorized: When authentication credentials are missing or invalid.
•	403 Forbidden: When the request is understood, but the server refuses to authorize it.
10.	A successful POST request returns a status code of 201 Created, indicating that a new resource has been successfully created.
11.	A successful DELETE request returns a status code of 204 No Content, indicating that the resource has been successfully deleted and there is no additional content to send in the response.
