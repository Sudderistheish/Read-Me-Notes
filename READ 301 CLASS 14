Consider the history: "That Time When Women Stopped Coding"
This article discusses the decline of women in computer science during the 1980s and onwards. The beginning of this decline coincided with the rise of personal computers and video games. As these technologies became more prevalent, they were often marketed towards boys, reinforcing the idea that computers were for boys. This led to a cultural shift that discouraged girls from pursuing computer science.

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
As mentioned earlier, the decline of women in computer science occurred during the rise of personal computers and video games that were predominantly marketed towards boys.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
Males growing up with more exposure to computers and technology had an advantage in terms of familiarity and comfort with these tools. This familiarity translated into a greater interest and proficiency in computer science and related fields. It further contributed to the gender disparity that exists in the tech industry today.
